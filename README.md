# Bouncing-Circles
This program was a challenge I set myself. One night during a LAN party, I got bored playing games and set myself the challenge by the end of the night I could created a program with bouncing balls and connecting lines (imspired by particles.js). I had no idea what I was doing as I had never really delved deep into understanding the C# graphics API's in Windows forms, so along the way I learnt a lot. Within a few hours I successfully managed to create working graphics and over the next few days I tweaked and optimised the program. The UI was not designed to look good as it was really just a proof of concept.

# Usage
Opening the solution in Visual Studio will allow you to change parameters in the code to tweak the properties of the balls such as size, radius boundaries of balls for lines, number of balls etc. When ready, compile and press start.


# What I learnt
- Gained a better understanding of Multi Threading
- Learned how to utilitse C# graphics APIS, to draw shapes
- Applied my theory knowledge of OOP by creating a circle object with defined properties and then initializing instances of those objects
- Was taught and shown by <a href="https://github.com/Tobolov">@Tobolov</a> why floats and doubles and faster than ints when performing arithmetic calculations
